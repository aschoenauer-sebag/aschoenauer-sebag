## Research interests
<p>During my PhD and post-doc, I focused on representation learning and outlier detection in high-content high-throughput image-based screens, using both classical and deep learning approaches. These screens can be drug screens, genomic screens, or environmental contaminant screens.
    The common principle is that cells are exposed to thousands of perturbations in parallel, following what fluorescence images are acquired.
    <br>
    On top of detecting novel compounds, I developed methods to answer more sophisticated questions, such as how to combine images from multiple microscopy experiments/laboratories. How does one
    perform multi-domain learning on high-content high-throughput screening data?

## Academic training

From Sep. 2016 to Sep. 2018, I was a post-doc in the <a href="http://www.altschulerwulab.org">Wu and Altschuler lab</a> (UCSF, San Francisco, USA). Prior to that, I did a PhD of Bioinformatics under the supervision of
<a href="http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~twalter/">Thomas Walter</a>, and the direction of <a href="https://t3s-1124.biomedicale.parisdescartes.fr/">Robert Barouki</a>
 and <a href="http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~jvert/">Jean-Philippe Vert</a> at the Center of Computational Biology (<a href="http://www.mines-paristech.fr/">Mines ParisTech</a>, Paris, France).

<p> Prior to that, I did the <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole Polytechnique</a> (Palaiseau, France), following 14 graduate-level courses in Computer science, Mathematics and Cell biology (X2007).
