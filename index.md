## Chief data scientist of the [_Inspection générale des finances_](http://www.igf.finances.gouv.fr/cms/sites/igf/accueil/igf-in-brief.html)

In February 2019, I joined the [Inspection générale des finances](http://www.igf.finances.gouv.fr/cms/sites/igf/accueil/igf-in-brief.html) as chief data scientist, where I started the data science practice. The _Inspection_ is the French governement general auditing service, performing circa 100 missions per year for public policy evaluation, strategic decision making and expert commission assistance. My team complements traditional approaches with ML and econometrics.

## Quick bio

I defended my PhD of Bioinformatics in December 2015 (CBIO, [Mines ParisTech](http://www.mines-paristech.fr/)), after three years under the supervision of [Thomas Walter](http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~twalter/), and the direction of [Robert Barouki](https://t3s-1124.biomedicale.parisdescartes.fr/) and [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~jvert/). During my PhD, I was interested in applying computer vision and machine learning methods to video-microscopy data. My research focused on the development of tools for automatic and quantitative characterization of cellular dynamic processes from video-microscopy data, following chemical exposure.

From September 2016 to October 2018, I was a post-doctoral scholar in the [Wu and Altschuler lab](http://www.altschulerwulab.org) (UCSF), where I focused on how to perform multi-domain learning on high-throughput image-based drug screens. Our work was the first to investigate how to combine images from multiple microscopy experiments/laboratories, and was accepted at ICLR'19 ([manuscript](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sklv5iRqYX)).

Between my PhD and my post-doc, I had the chance to develop machine learning approaches for challenging real world problems and data related to insurance fraud detection at [Shift technology](http://www.shift-technology.com/).
