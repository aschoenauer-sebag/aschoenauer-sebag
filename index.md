## Chief data scientist of the [_Inspection générale des finances_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_des_finances_(France))

In February 2019, I joined the [Inspection générale des finances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_des_finances_(France)) (French Ministry for the Economy and Finance) to launch the data science practice. The Inspection is France’s general consulting service, performing circa 100 missions per year for public policy evaluation, strategic decision making and expert commission assistance. My team complements traditional approaches with ML and econometrics. 
Since its creation, I grew the team from one to five people; we participated in over 20 projects.

## Quick bio

I defended my PhD of Bioinformatics in December 2015 (CBIO, [Mines ParisTech](http://www.mines-paristech.fr/)), after three years under the supervision of [Thomas Walter](http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~twalter/), and the direction of [Robert Barouki](https://t3s-1124.biomedicale.parisdescartes.fr/) and [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~jvert/). During my PhD, I was interested in applying computer vision and machine learning methods to video-microscopy data. My research focused on the development of tools for automatic and quantitative characterization of cellular dynamic processes from video-microscopy data, following chemical exposure.

From September 2016 to October 2018, I was a post-doctoral scholar in the [Wu and Altschuler lab](http://www.altschulerwulab.org) (UCSF), where I focused on how to perform multi-domain learning on high-throughput image-based drug screens. Our work was the first to investigate how to combine images from multiple microscopy experiments/laboratories, and was accepted at [ICLR'19](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sklv5iRqYX).
On our way to this result, we found a novel adaptive stochastic gradient descent algorithm for deep learning optimization ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01427)). The main idea is to accelerate (respectively, decelerate) exponentially when gradient directions are correlated over time (respectively, are alternating), while incorporating a statistical test to detect emergencies (gradient explosion) and backtrack.

Between my PhD and my post-doc, I seconded the CSO in starting the R&D team and building the Healthcare product at [Shift technology](http://www.shift-technology.com/). The company has since then grown from 20 to over 250 employees and raised €88M total, to fight insurance fraud and automate insurance claims.
